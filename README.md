### Important
The backend API is limited to a particular set of results as it uses a fixed set of cached search results, more informations can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
